This is a simple server for running Baroque Chess agents. Created for CSE415 @ UW.

Includes code by Steve Tanimoto and Yue Zhang.

Requirements: [svgutils](https://github.com/btel/svg_utils), flask

To run: `python3 server.py`

This requires a list of player agents in a file called `player_list.txt` in the same directory, one on each line, without the `.py` extension.
